**VillageVoice** is a full-stack **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application designed to **bridge the gap between rural citizens and local governance**. It empowers villagers to submit complaints or development suggestions, while enabling admins to manage these inputs effectively.

> ⚡ _Built with real-world use cases in mind, especially for rural areas that lack a digital feedback system._
